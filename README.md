 In most ticketing systems there is an email capability so every time you update the ticket, the user gets a copy and they can respond. (Working the Issue)
 It’s fine to fix things on the spot, but generally speaking, you want to create tickets for EVERYTHING you do.

When the issue is resolved to completion all there is to do is confirm with the end-user and close out the ticket! (Resolution)
It is always good to follow up with customers if neccessary.
